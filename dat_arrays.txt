version 2 -- Adds default dummy reqs for spread creep (0x66) and place addon (0x24) orders.dat,
    necessary since tatti doesn't make distinction between no reqs enabled and no reqs disabled.
version 3 -- Fixes place addon req from "Is Landed building" to "Has no Addon"
    (Lifted off buildings couldn't build addons)
version 4 -- changes reserved unit ids to use 0xe4 for subunit 1/2/infestation, sight to 1,
    orders to 23, weapons to 130.
